              Kia Ora, I'm Shae. Wellington is where I currently reside, but let
              me tell you about my heart's home: Taranaki. (Hell yeah, Taranaki
              Hardcore) The Patea River holds a special place in my soul; it
              runs through my hometown, Stratford. As a kid, my friends and I
              practically lived in its waters, especially when those hot summers
              hit. When I was just four, my nan would take my sister and me
              across Taranaki, showing the very essence of her upbringing,
              sharing the tales of significance and the deep-rooted history of
              each spot. Our adventures took us to beaches, rivers, and into the
              heart of the 'wop wops'(that's what we call the lush countryside,
              thick with trees and bushes) Those journeys kept me grounded,
              nurturing my Hauora.
            </p>
            <p>
              P.S I love you Nana, thank you for making me the man I am today.

              Let's dive into music, something that's deeply meaningful to me.
              It's been shaped by the diverse influences of my upbringing and
              surroundings. From my aunt's R&B vibes to the catchy tunes of
              Backstreet Boys and NSYNC courtesy of my grandma, music has always
              been a part of my Life. Those car rides to visit family, with
              Backstreet Boys blaring and all of us singing along, are memories
              I hold dear. As I grew, I began to explore my own music taste,
              discovering artists like Ne-Yo, Akon, TLC, Usher and many more. My
              primary school days were marked by a little Jonas Brothers
              obsession, which unexpectedly opened the door to the vibrant world
              of K-pop in my final year of primary. In 2014, BTS and other
              groups became a significant part of my playlist.Throughout my
              teenage years, my music palette expanded to a variety of genres:
              K-pop, R&B, K-R&B pop, rap, Latin beats, J-pop, rock, and reggae.
              Nowadays, my go-to genre is R&B, with a little bit of K-pop and an
              big mix of other genres. SZA, Jungkook and Khamari currently top
              my list of favorites.But let's change gears. If you've read this
              far, I'd love to hear your song recommendations. I'm always up for
              discovering new music!<br />
              I also influenced my blog around spotify, to show the love of
              listening to music.
