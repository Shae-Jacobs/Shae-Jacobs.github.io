            <p class="Paragraph">
              An ethical decision I faced involved making the decision to
              emotionally distance myself from one of my aunts. Her actions in a
              this situation conflicted with my moral values and caused me pain,
              especially since we had been close during my upbringing. After
              carefully considering my values, I made the difficult choice to
              reduce contact with her. It was a painful decision because it
              meant severing an important relationship for my personal growth.
              Reflecting on this decision, I believe it was better for my
              well-being. Even if she apologizes and changes her behavior in the
              future, rebuilding that trust and forgiveness will take time.

            <h3>
              Describe how your culture and the people around you have
              influenced your values and identity.
            </h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
              Being raised by my Nan has shaped my values and identity a lot. As
              a Jehovah's Witness, she instilled in me the importance of never
              judging others, practicing forgiveness, and treating everyone
              equally through our regular church attendance. Although I no
              longer attend church, those years engraved important values. My
              relationship with my mother has been complex to say the least.
              Initially unable to care for me adequately, she later re-entered
              my life. Despite past hardships and the challenging environment
              she put me through, this period taught me resilience and set
              standards for myself. Learning about her struggles with addiction
              gave me empathy, encouraging me to prioritize understanding over
              personal grievances. Empathy and understanding are values I hold
              close to my heart. Not having a father figure was challenging,
              leaving me to question my identity and cultural roots. The absence
              of paternal guidance forced me to navigate self-discovery
              independently, which was to say the least... hard. Growing up
              alongside my older sister, who always looked out for me whether at
              school or in public, was truly endearing. She consistently aimed
              for academic excellence and held a high social status, which
              sometimes made me feel inadequate and envious. However, as I
              matured, I began to want to achieve more and expand my own goals.
              My sister's influence taught me the importance of cherishing
              family bonds and maintaining determination towards my goals. I am
              grateful to my loving Nan and Older sister for providing stability
              and guidance during this important time in my life.

              Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
              learning journey.
            </h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
              My strengths lie in my easy going nature; while I may come across
              as shy, I easily warm up to people as I get to understand and know
              them better. Finding a frequency within myself that resonates with
              them, this makes for effective collaborations in pair and group
              projects. Another strength of mine is my empathetic nature; I am
              always mindfull of others feelings and circumstances, which
              enhances my ability to support my peers. Additionally, my strong
              determination drives me to constantly learn and grow, making me
              understand more in my studies.

            </h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
              One limitation I face is perfectionism. I have a strong desire for
              things to meet my standards, which can sometimes lead to me
              burning out on specific aspects of tasks. This can result in
              stress or procrastination as I work for perfection. This could
              impact my learning journey by causing me being burnout or falling
              behind my peers.

            <p class="Paragraph">
              In a previous job, I often found myself working alongside new team
              members due to turnover. There was some resistance as I took on
              the role of leadership and worked to foster teamwork among us.
              Often, I was younger than them, which made it challenging to
              assert myself. I approached the situation with patience,
              shouldering most of the workload until they became more
              proficient. I focused on finding common ground and engaging them
              in comfortable conversations while we worked together. Reflecting
              on this experience, I realize I should have been more assertive in
              my communication. I believe that asserting myself better could
              have sped up their improvement and enhanced our teamwork sooner.
