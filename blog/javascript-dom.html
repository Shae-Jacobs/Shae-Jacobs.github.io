              An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
              CSS.
            </h3>
            <div class="Paragraph">
              <p>
                I'll be using the analogy of developing a video game to describe
                the relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript.
              </p>
              <p>
                HTML is likened towards the structures and objects inside the
                game world. This could include terrain, buildings, characters,
                and objects that populate the game environment. HTML elements
                establish the basic structure of a web page, such as headers,
                paragraphs, images, and containers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside the game world CSS is similar to the visual design and
                atmosphere within the game. It determines the visual style,
                colors, textures, animations, and overall aesthetic appeal of
                the game world and characters. CSS styles enhance the appearance
                of HTML. Applying visuals and looks to the webpage.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is like the gameplay mechanics and interactive parts
                within the game world. For example that could be quests, a
                working menu and how your character moves and acts. JavaScript
                allows for the wepage to be interactive for it's users.

            <h3>Explain control flow and loops</h3>
            <div class="Paragraph">
              <p>
                Let's explore the concept of Control Flow and Loops by using the
                analogy of managing a Steam game library.<br />
                <strong>Control flow:</strong><br />
                Managing a Steam game library invloves a few steps.<br />
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Purchasing the Game:</strong> Start by acquiring the
                  new game from the Steam store.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Installing the Game:</strong>Install the New Game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Launching the Game:</strong>After installation, you
                  can now launch the new Game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Updating the Game:</strong>Sometimes games need
                  updates, you need to install the latest version of the game to
                  ensure you have all the latest features and Bug fixes.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>In this process:</strong> Each step depends on the
                completion of the previous step (you can't launch a game without
                first installing it). The flow is linear and follows a specific
                order to ensure games are ready to play.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Loops:</strong><br />
                Now, in a situation where you want to manage updates for
                multiple games in your library.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Check for updates:</strong> Begin by checking if any
                  games in your library have pending updates available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Download updates:</strong> For games that have
                  updates available, download the necessary files to update the
                  game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Install updates:</strong>Once downloaded, install the
                  updates for each game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Repeat for all games:</strong> Loop back to the
                  beginning and continue checking and updating until all games
                  in your library are up to date.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The looping process ensures that every game is checked and
                updated as required. The loop continues until a condition (all
                games updated) is met.

                    The DOM which is short for Document Object Model, is like a

                    this to access different elements on the page. Each
