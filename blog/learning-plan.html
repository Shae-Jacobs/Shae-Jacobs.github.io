            <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
              I aspire to enter the coding industry, whether it's front-end,
              back-end, or full-stack development. My goal is to work in a
              dynamic field where I can continuously learn and evolve alongside
              technological advancements.

              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
              My strengths lie in my determination and constant eagerness to
              expand my knowledge and skills. I approach learning with patience,
              effectively balancing study with other activities, such as gaming.
              However, I acknowledge several limitations: I tend to
              procrastinate, often delaying tasks when I lose motivation. This
              procrastination is sometimes linked to my perfectionism, which
              drives me to ensure things are as I envision them. While this
              attention to detail can be a positive, it can also lead me to
              spend more time working on tasks. If something doesn't meet my
              standards, I may procrastinate addressing it until it aligns with
              my expectations.

            <p class="Paragraph">
              I aim to enhance multiple areas of my personal development while
              studying here. Firstly, I want to improve my time management
              skills to maximise my productivity and efficiency. Secondly,
              refining my problem-solving skills to align more closely with
              coding (Thinking like a programmer). Additionally, I would like to
              transition my follower mentality to develop leadership skills,
              making me take initiative. Lastly, Building self-confidence by
              taking on a positive perspective and having some affirmation in my
              capabilities which will establish a strong sense of belonging and
              competence.
