              <p>
                I've been steadily overcoming my limitations, especially through
                my determination during foundations. One of my strengths that
                has emerged is my passion for absorbing knowledge and applying
                it effectively. However, one of my ongoing challenges remains my
                lack of self-confidence in my abilities. While I'm actively
                working on improving this aspect, it's a journey that requires
                time and effort.

            <section class="Paragraph">
              <p>
                One of my primary non-technical challenges during bootcamp will
                undoubtedly be developing a deeper understanding of my peers and
                finding common ground with them. Being naturally shy, I feel
                nervous about speaking in front of groups as well.

            <section class="Paragraph">
              <p>
                To me, support during bootcamp means consistently verbalizing
                encouragement and backing us throughout our journey. It also
                means maintaining an understanding mindset if any of us
                encounter challenges outside of bootcamp. Based on my experience
                during foundations, I'm confident that support won't be
                something I need to worry about.

              My strengths lie in my determination and constant eagerness to
              expand my knowledge and skills. I approach learning with patience,
              effectively balancing study with other activities, such as gaming.
              However, I acknowledge several limitations: I tend to
              procrastinate, often delaying tasks when I lose motivation. This
              procrastination is sometimes linked to my perfectionism, which
              drives me to ensure things are as I envision them. While this
              attention to detail can be a positive, it can also lead me to
              spend more time working on tasks. If something doesn't meet my
              standards, I may procrastinate addressing it until it aligns with
              my expectations.
