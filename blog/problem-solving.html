            <h2>A time when I was blocked on a simple problem.</h2>

              <p>
                I encountered a hurdle during the debbee challenge when I
                struggled with formatting .filter() to exclude "buzz". After
                conducting research and completing an exercise, I began to grasp
                the concept better. Throughout this process, I wrestled with
                where to place .toLowerCase(), but eventually, I figured it out.

            <section class="Paragraph">
              One instance where I elegantly solved a problem was during the
              gradebook exercise, specifically when I needed to add a new
              property with a key. Drawing from my previous experience with
              objects proved invaluable; it provided a clear framework for
              tackling the task. Reflecting on how I utilized objects in prior
              exercises helped me seamlessly integrate the new property into the
              gradebook exercise.

            </h2>
            <section class="Paragraph">
              Throughout this challenge, I employed a variety of problem-solving
              techniques, including pseudocode, the rubber duck method,
              Googling, and console logging. Googling different concepts enabled
              me to explore their applications and understand them better
              through examples of code in action. Another effective strategy was
              using the rubber duck method, where articulating my issues aloud
              helped me pinpoint mistakes and self-correct effectively.

              Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider
              what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently
              next time?
            </h2>
            <section class="Paragraph">
              Throughout this challenge, I hesitated to ask many questions
              because I believed I should grasp everything on my own. However,
              as a friend wisely says, 'asking a question may make you feel
              foolish for a moment, but not asking can leave you ignorant
              forever.' While I didn't directly seek help, I did benefit from
              others' questions on Discord to solve my own problems. Next time,
              I realize the importance of reaching out sooner for assistance,
              enabling me to resolve issues promptly rather than waiting for
              others to face similar challenges.
